### This project provides a simple calendar application built using the Tkinter library in Python and the tkcalendar widget. It allows users to view and interact with a basic calendar, displaying the current month with the ability to navigate to previous and next months. When the user clicks on a selected date, it will be displayed at the bottom of the calendar.
